A simple game to bet on horses. Soon I'll have a function that will alter horses' movement rates at least once during the race to account for things like sprinting or fatigue.


There are no graphics -- it's all textbased. But still fun!


To run, open your command line and navigate to the directory the file is saved at.
then type "Python racehorse.py" (unless you saved it as some other filename).
Must have Python 2.6.X or greater to play it.



feel free to do whatever you want with the program (except make profit from it!) Just as long as you give me credit, i'll be happy.

Enjoy!
