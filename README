This is my third project in Python. It is a simple, text-based horseracing game.

There are a few additions I'll make at some point, such as the ability to win
more money based on the odds of the horse winning and horse qualities such as 
sprinting, becoming winded, etc, that will affect their speed partially through the race.


feel free to do whatever you want with the program (except make profit from it!) Just as long as you give me credit, i'll be happy.

Enjoy!
