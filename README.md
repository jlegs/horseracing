A simple game to bet on horses. There are no graphics -- it's all textbased. But still fun!

This is one of my early attempts at programming, so there are several bad practices in here (can you say 'globals'?)


To run, open your command line and navigate to the directory the file is saved at.
then type "Python racehorse.py" (unless you saved it as some other filename).
Must have Python 2.6.X or greater to play it.



feel free to do whatever you want with the program. Covered under the GPL license.

Enjoy!
